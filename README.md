This is repository provides resources for the EarthImages WhiteLabels service from Geocento.

EarthImages WhiteLabels -or EI-WL- is Geocento's white label version of our flagship product EarthImages NEO. It is a software as a service running on AWS which can be deployed in minutes to provide our customers a customised instance for their own users or internally.

It covers all basic features of an online satellite data procurement and exploitation platform, from searching and finding data to ordering, processing and publishing the data. It can be customised at many levels, including, but not limited to: branding, sensors selection, ordering policies, third party and custom processing...

Part of the configuration of a EI-WL instance is the ordering adapter scripts (to automatically order a product from the supplier) and the true colour conversion process (to turn a raw product into a true colour image which can be used and viewed in a map). Example implementations of these resources are provided free of charge in this repository and can be used directly in your EI-WL instance(s).
